The style I'm looking for is blackwork. I want to tattoo my whole body, including my hands and neck.
I would like to start with arms-chest-neck and legs.
Please let me know what you think, I trust more your knowledge than mine that is based on pure observation
Before everything, I want to tell you that if you go back to NYC I have the possibility to move there some months or the time that is needed if that makes the process easier (like taking measures, speaking with me, or something). I also can pay upfront to book these sessions if that makes your life easier too. Whatever it takes man 
These are things that are the most important for me:

<h2>â—‹ Harmony with the body.</h2>
Tatto shapes that make the body look more symmetric (Like a suit)
